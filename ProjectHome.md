A simple trading model based on pair pattern strategy space with holding periods is proposed.
Power-law behaviors are observed for the return variance ¾2, the price impactH and
the predictability K for both models with linear and square root impact functions. The sum
of the traders’ wealth displays a positive value for the model with square root price impact
function, and a qualitative explanation is given based on the observation of the conditional
excess demand hAjui. The cumulative wealth distribution also obeys a power-law behavior
with an exponent close to that of the real markets. An evolutionary trading model is further
proposed. The elimination mechanism effectively changes the behavior of the traders, and
a power-law behavior is observed in the measure of zero return distribution P(r = 0).
The trading model with other types of traders, e.g., traders with the MG’s strategies and
producers, are also carefully studied.
